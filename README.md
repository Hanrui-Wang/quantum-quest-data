# quantum-quest-data
There are three data folders in this directory. The first is `raw_data_qasm`, in which each file is a tuple list. Each tuple has three elements. The first is the quantum circuit, described by OpenQasm. The second one is a dictionary representing the property of the backend. And the third is the fidelity of the circuits. The second is `pyg_data`, in which the raw data are converted to a Pytorch Geometric dataset. The circuit and backend properties are features, while the fidelities are labels. The third one is `normalized_data`, in which the data are further normalized to provide better performance for the neural network.

The data are generated by the `examples/quest/utils/load_data.py` script in the TorchQuantum repository.
